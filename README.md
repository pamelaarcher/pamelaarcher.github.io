## Setting Up and Running The Application

### About
This application is made up of 3 main website page files as well as a number of css, js, and images files
  - <b>index.html</b> which displays the navigation bar and introduction to the site
  - <b>profile.html</b> which displays a card of my general information as well as my bio and video
  - <b>projects.html</b> which includes cards for each of the highlighted projects.  Each includes title, image, description and links to the repository, readme and demo
  - <b>assets directory</b> includes a <b>css</b> directory which includes the core bootstrap css file and a custom css file for any changes I made to the bootstrap classes or added.  The <b>js</b> directory includes the core bootstrap.bundle.min.js file.  The <b>img</b> directory contains all images used on the site.
### Running the Application
 (1) You can download a zip file of the pamelaarcher.github.io respository to a directory on your local drive.  Once installed in a directory, run the index.html file from a new web page OR you can run the application direct from github from the link, https://pamelaarcher.github.io/  <br />
 (2) Click on the top button and see the vehicles move
 
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
•	Inclusion of a main landing page that introduces the user to the site
•	Look at additional images that can add to replace my "avatar"
•	Look at general colors and how to make more professional for example with use of background images, etc
